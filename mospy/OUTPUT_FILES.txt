PLOTS (made in plotSim.py)

All plots use true time if plotting against time as of 7 June 2018. Previously
used the suggested time step resulting in jitteriness of the forcetime plots.

Force graphs show the magnitude of the force on the mirror.
    forcetime.png
        Force over time of the system
    forcetimeComponents.png
        Force over time of the system broken down into components.

Mirror energy graphs show the amount of energy the mirror has (total energy).
Helpful in seeing how additionalForces change how much energy the mirror has.
    mirrorEnergy.png
        Total mirror energy over time
    mirrorEnergyPercentChange.png
        Total mirror energy percent change over time
    mirrorEnergyToP
        Total mirror energy relative to the planet's energy over time.
        Helpful in seeing how much energy the mirror has without the energy of the
        planet added in.

Overview plots give a wide top view of the planet and mirror's positions
relative to the star. Helpful in seeing how far around the planet goes
around the star. The blue line overlays the mirror which is the orange line.
    overviewXY.png
        Overview location plot in the XY plane
    overviewXZ.png
        Overview location plot in the XZ plane
    overviewZY.png
        Overview location plot in the ZY plane

Planet Centered plots are used when the stationary plots get confusing. Mainly
when the mirror does not orbit the planet in the XY plane. Okay to use for
looking at things like thrust.
    planetcenXY.png
        Planet centered plot of the mirror and planet in the XY plane.
        The would appear to orbit the planet in this perspective.
    planetcenXZ.png
        Planet centered plot of the mirror and planet in the XZ plane.
        The would appear to orbit the planet in this perspective.
    planetcenZY.png
        Planet centered plot of the mirror and planet in the ZY plane.
        The would appear to orbit the planet in this perspective.

Stationary plots are mainly used to see how radiation pressure affects the mirror
by keeping the star and planet still. This way RP always comes from the same
direction/point.
    stationaryXY.png
        Rotating reference frame (star and planet stay still) in the XY plane,
        Star is always to the left.
    stationaryXZ.png
        Rotating reference frame (star and planet stay still) in the XZ plane
        Star is always to the left.
    stationaryZY.png
        Rotating reference frame (star and planet stay still) in the ZY plane
        Star is always to the left.

Total energy plots are helpful in seeing if the system conserves energy when
it should.
    totalEnergy.png
        Total energy of the system over time
    totalEnergyPercentChange.png
        Total energy percent change of the system over time
    totalEnergyPercentChangeREB.png
        Total energy percent change of the system over time calculated by rebound
    totalEnergyREB.png
        Total energy of the system over time calculated by rebound
3D.png
    Currently disabled. 3D plot of mirror about planet. In stationary rotating
    reference frame.

Post sim plots can be made w/ SimTools in Packages.
    mdistp.png
        Mirror distance to the planet over time.
    velmirror.png
        Mirror resultant velocity relative to the planet over time.
